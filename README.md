## Final Notes
- I was planning to use Hilt Dependency Injection and also save the previous search state while navigating through fragment, however, for saving time and completing the process, I couldn't added those features. There is also a bug which is keyboard opens on start of the fragment. I added the closing line to manifest but maybe it's only on my emulator device.
